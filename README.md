Poster based on the visual representation of the Gameplay Framework in the Unreal Engine [documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-framework-in-unreal-engine).

### Introduction and goals

I have been working in Unreal Engine for the better part of five years. The Gameplay Framework is a great reference that can help a lot of people find their way around in development, especially if they are switching to Unreal from other engines or Unreal is their first game engine.
Since no printable version of this visual representation existed publicly [(and there was a forum thread asking for one)](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/gameplay-framework-poster-for-printing/2355172), I decided to create one myself.

- Most colors are derived from the PANTONE C library, and are loosely based on the color coding of Epic's visual representation
- Extra color and gradient swatches for proofing are included in the file. They help checking color accuracy and bleed. In print tests, I got fairly good results using [Fomei Photo Matt 230](https://www.fomei.com/en/products-photo-matt-230-36047/1)
